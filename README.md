# Java Dynamic Proxy Example ‚Äì README

This project demonstrates the concept of **Java Dynamic Proxies** using a real-world example of a `Man` class implementing a `Person` interface. Let's break down all the concepts and the flow involved in the program, including Java fundamentals like classes, interfaces, `this`, `@Override`, and dynamic proxying.

---

## üîç Key Java Concepts

### ‚úÖ Class
A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. It contains fields (attributes) and methods (behavior). In this project, `Man` is a class representing a person with name, age, city, and country.

### ‚úÖ Interface
An **interface** in Java defines a contract. Classes that implement an interface agree to provide implementations for its methods. `Person` is an interface that `Man` implements.

### ‚úÖ @Override
The `@Override` annotation is used to indicate that a method is being overridden from a superclass or interface. For example, `introduce()` in `Man` overrides the interface method.

### ‚úÖ this Keyword
The `this` keyword refers to the current object. Used when you want to refer to instance variables inside methods (especially if parameters have the same name).

### ‚úÖ Abstract Class (Mentioned for clarity)
An **abstract class** is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and may have abstract (unimplemented) methods. Unlike interfaces, it can contain both implemented and unimplemented methods.

### ‚úÖ Static Method (Mentioned for clarity)
A **static method** belongs to the class rather than the object. It can be called without creating an instance.

## üß† Concept Behind This Project ‚Äì Java Dynamic Proxies

### üîó What is a Dynamic Proxy?
A **dynamic proxy** allows us to intercept method calls on an interface and define custom behavior before or after invoking the actual method. This is useful for logging, transaction management, security checks, etc.

### ‚úÖ InvocationHandler
This interface defines one method: `invoke()`. You use it to specify what happens when a method is called on a proxy object.

**Real-world Analogy**: Imagine you're a celebrity (the real object), and your manager (proxy) handles your calls, interviews, and messages. Before every call, the manager announces "This is on behalf of the celebrity", and then either handles it themselves or passes it to you. That's what a dynamic proxy is.

---

## üì¶ Project Structure & Working

- **`Person.java` (Interface)**: Defines three methods ‚Äì `introduce()`, `sayAge()`, and `sayWhereFrom()`.
- **`Man.java` (Implements Person)**: Implements all methods. Represents the actual object.
- **`PersonInvocationHandler.java`**: Intercepts calls using `invoke()` and forwards them using `method.invoke(person, args)`.
- **`Main.java`**: 
  - Creates an instance of `Man`
  - Uses `Proxy.newProxyInstance()` to create a dynamic proxy object.
  - Calls the method using the proxy ‚Äì which is intercepted by `PersonInvocationHandler`.

### üîÑ Flow of Execution
1. Main method calls `introduce()` via proxy.
2. Proxy intercepts it using `invoke()` in `PersonInvocationHandler`.
3. Handler logs the method name.
4. Forwards the call to the actual `Man` object.

---

## üìò Summary

- **Java Classes and Interfaces** provide modular code design.
- **Dynamic Proxies** intercept and extend method behavior at runtime.
- **InvocationHandler** controls the behavior of proxy instances.
- Useful in frameworks like Spring AOP, Hibernate, and JDK proxies.

This example teaches **clean code structure**, **reflection**, and **AOP fundamentals** in a beginner-friendly way.

# üîç Java Dynamic Proxy ‚Äì Execution Flow Explained with Code

This README explains **how the code works step-by-step** with **control flow**, **proxy usage**, and relevant **Java code snippets** from your project.

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Execution Flow

Let's go through how the program runs, from the `main()` method to dynamic proxy handling.

---

### üü© Step 1: Application Starts in `Main.java`

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Man mohan = new Man("Mohan", 30, "delhi", "india");

        ClassLoader mohanClassLoader = mohan.getClass().getClassLoader();
        Class[] interfaces = mohan.getClass().getInterfaces();

        Person proxyMohan = (Person) Proxy.newProxyInstance(
            mohanClassLoader,
            interfaces,
            new PersonInvocationHandler(mohan)
        );

        proxyMohan.introduce(mohan.getName());
    }
}
```

### üî∏ Explanation:
- A new object `mohan` of class `Man` is created.
- The **class loader** and list of **interfaces** implemented by `Man` (i.e., `Person`) are retrieved.
- A **dynamic proxy object** `proxyMohan` is created that wraps `mohan`, using `PersonInvocationHandler`.

---

### üü© Step 2: `Man.java` ‚Äì Our Real Object

```java
public class Man implements Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private String city;
    private String country;

    public Man(String name, int age, String city, String country) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.city = city;
        this.country = country;
    }

    @Override
    public void introduce(String name) {
        System.out.println("My name is " + this.name);
    }

    @Override
    public void sayAge(int age) {
        System.out.println("I am " + this.age + " years old");
    }

    @Override
    public void sayWhereFrom(String city, String country) {
        System.out.println("I am from " + this.city + ", " + this.country);
    }

    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }
}
```

---

### üü© Step 3: `Person.java` ‚Äì Interface

```java
public interface Person {
    void introduce(String name);
    void sayAge(int age);
    void sayWhereFrom(String city, String country);
}
```

- Interface that defines methods `Man` must implement.
- Used in proxy creation to define which methods can be intercepted.

---

### üü© Step 4: `PersonInvocationHandler.java` ‚Äì Proxy Interceptor

```java
public class PersonInvocationHandler implements InvocationHandler {
    private Person person;

    public PersonInvocationHandler(Person person) {
        this.person = person;
    }

    @Override
    public Object invoke(Object proxy, Method method, Object[] args) throws Throwable {
        System.out.println("[Proxy Interception] Method called: " + method.getName());
        return method.invoke(person, args);
    }
}
```

- Implements `InvocationHandler`, a standard interface for handling proxy calls.
- The `invoke()` method intercepts all method calls to `proxyMohan`.
- It prints a message and **forwards the method call** to the real object (`mohan`) using reflection.

---

## üß† What are Proxies Doing?

- `proxyMohan` is not a real `Man` object, but **looks like a Person**.
- When you call `proxyMohan.introduce(...)`, it doesn't go directly to `Man.introduce`.
- Instead, it goes to `invoke()` in `PersonInvocationHandler`.
- There, the method is intercepted (e.g., for logging, security), then passed on to `mohan`.

---

## üõ† Real World Analogy

Think of a **Receptionist (Proxy)** who:
- Accepts requests on behalf of the **Manager (Real Object)**.
- Logs who's visiting.
- Then passes the message to the manager.

In the same way:
- Proxy logs/intercepts method calls.
- Then delegates to the actual object.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Concept | Role |
|--------|------|
| `Man` | Real object |
| `Person` | Interface |
| `Proxy.newProxyInstance` | Creates a proxy that wraps `Man` |
| `InvocationHandler` | Defines how method calls are handled/intercepted |

That's how dynamic proxy and control flow work in your code!
